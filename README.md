## 1. Idea

When starting this project, my goal was to gain experience with various techniques and packages by practicing with React. I aimed to work on a project that would encompass nearly all modern web development processes. I realized that an e-commerce site requires a comprehensive state management structure, multiple route management, high performance, and optimization efforts. Additionally, since a user-friendly and simple interface needs to be compatible across different devices, I decided this project offered a valuable opportunity for extensive work.

## 2. Resources and Research Process

Before starting the project, I conducted thorough research on the technologies used in the industry and best practices. I analyzed the strengths of technologies like React, Redux, and Firebase. I also worked on tools that would enrich the user experience, using Material UI, Framer Motion, and other UI/UX libraries. I utilized resources such as technical articles, open-source projects, and courses.

## 3. Project Features

While determining the project features, I analyzed the functionalities and shortcomings of competing e-commerce platforms. In addition to fundamental requirements like a user-friendly interface, fast performance, easy navigation, and seamless payment experiences, I focused on features that would make the project unique. Among these unique values, creating a help and support page, having user-friendly steps for payment processes, and using project-specific JSON data played significant roles. The project is designed to maximize the user experience.

## 4. Project Storyboard and Prototyping

Before starting the project, storyboard designs were prepared. These drafts provided a clear idea of which pages and components would be included in the project, how these components would interact, and how the designs would present a visual layout. During this process, the focus was on the user journey and user experience.

## 5. Use of Tools and Resources

Before starting the project, I decided on the tools and technologies to be used. Technologies such as React, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, React Router, and Material UI were identified as the foundational elements of this project. Libraries like Framer Motion for animations, React Hook Form for form management, and Zod for data validation were integrated into the project. These tools offered ideal solutions to meet project goals and provide a user-friendly, performance-oriented experience.

## 6. Project Initiation

After determining the necessary technologies and goals, we moved on to the project initiation phase. The project structure and overall file architecture were established. During the development process, a targeted roadmap for project management was followed. A development strategy was created for each step according to the specified features and technologies.

## 7. Project File Architecture

The project was organized in a modular structure. Basic folder structures such as `shared`, `pages`, `schema`, and `routes` were defined. Reusable components were created among the project components, ensuring an organized and scalable file architecture. This structure made the project more readable and manageable.

## 8. Breaking the Project into Phases

The project was divided into different phases for easier management. Subsections such as authentication processes, database connections, management of products and categories, form validation steps, and animation integration were defined. This approach allowed each step to be addressed independently, providing greater control during the development process.

## 9. Coding Process

The coding process progressed step by step in line with the established goals. Key functions were developed for each component, and the user interface was optimized for device compatibility. During this process:
- The frontend was developed and made compatible with various devices.
- Database connections and data operations were carried out using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Form validation processes were completed using React Hook Form and Zod.
- Animations were added to the project with Framer Motion, enhancing the user experience.

## 10. Performance and Optimization

Various optimization techniques were applied to improve the project's performance. Techniques such as lazy loading of images were used to enhance page loading speeds. Unnecessary code fragments were cleaned up based on the helpers structure and SOLID principles, resulting in a more modular architecture. The project's network performance was tested using browser Network tools, analyzing and optimizing resource consumption.

![PerformansIncelemeleri](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/795fa5ef-6068-4794-8c60-6c93d2297d6c)

### Performance Optimization Techniques

- **Image Optimization**: PNG and JPG image files were converted to **WEBP** format for faster loading, reducing file sizes by up to 87%.

- **useMemo and useCallback**: These hooks were used to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Component recalculation and creation only occur when necessary.

- **Lazy Loading**: Images were loaded using the **react-lazy-load-image-component** with lazy loading techniques, ensuring that only visible images are loaded when the page is first opened, enhancing loading speed.

- **useDebounce**: This hook was used in search operations to prevent continuous data queries from users, avoiding unnecessary **fetch** calls.

- **Code Splitting**: Using **React.lazy** and **Suspense**, components were loaded in chunks, ensuring that only necessary components are loaded initially rather than the entire page.

- **Tree Shaking**: This principle removes unused imports, code fragments, and whitespace from the project. As a result, only the required modules are included, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.

- **Static File Caching**: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images were cached using hosting services like **Netlify**, providing faster access for users when reloading the page.


## 11. Security and Testing Process

For project security, environment variables were protected, and Firebase "Rules" were implemented. User data, authentication processes, and database access were secured. Bugs and issues in the project were systematically identified and resolved through extensive testing. Various test scenarios were conducted to ensure the application operates smoothly.

## 12. Deployment Phase

Once the development process was completed, the project was configured and deployed on Netlify. Necessary environment settings and configurations were established on Netlify to ensure the successful integration of the project into the live environment.

## 13. User Feedback and Maintenance Phase

After the project went live, user feedback began to be collected. Adjustments were made based on this feedback, and the project has been continuously monitored. Maintenance processes are still ongoing, with regular updates aimed at improving user experience.
